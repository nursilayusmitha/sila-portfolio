Furthermore, there's a QR code-based ticketing system, complaint tracking, and a voucher management system with usage history. The entire admin panel is responsive and supports dark mode for user comfort.\n\nOn the Customer Frontend, users can enjoy a seamless experience with JWT-based authentication, profile management, and a redeemable voucher system. Customers can easily place orders, track their status, and view their transaction and complaint history.\n\nEvery purchased ticket comes with a unique QR code for a fast validation process. This frontend is fully responsive and supports dark mode, ensuring optimal accessibility across various devices.\n\nThe project is built using Express.js as the backend framework, MongoDB with Mongoose for the database, and leverages a variety of other key technologies such as jsonwebtoken for secure authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and nodemailer for email services.\n\nThe system also integrates node-cron for scheduled tasks, a QR code API for tickets, and dashboard-ready APIs for analytics, making it a robust and integrated end-to-end solution.",
